<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>

Hi! I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Cornell University supervised by Prof. Kilian. Q. Weinberger. I'm broadly interested in machine learning algorithm and have worked on projects on Information Retrieval, diffusion models and ML applications in studying Quantum systems.  

Before I came to Cornell, I received my BS degree in physics from Ludwig Maximilian University Munich and MSc degree in mathematical and theoretical physics from Oxford University.
